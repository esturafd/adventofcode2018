# Advent of code 2018

This is my repository for the response of the advent of code 2018. The idea is
to do it with several languages trying some with which I have not programmed or
not programmed much.

## day 1: Bash

The first puzzle was easy, the second had to put him to measure the time it took,
leave it running for 3 hours maybe.

```
pront> ./script1.sh
The resulting frequency is 477

pront> ./script2.sh
The resulting frequency is 390
```
