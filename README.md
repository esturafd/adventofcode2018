# Advent of code 2018

This is my repository for the response of the advent of code 2018. The idea is
to do it with several languages trying some with which I have not programmed or
not programmed much.

## day 1: Bash

For the first day I chose a known language and the first puzzle was easy.
For second I had to put it to measure the time it took,leave it running for 3
hours maybe.

```
pront> ./script1.sh
The resulting frequency is 477

pront> ./script2.sh
The resulting frequency is 390
```
## day 2: Rust

On the second day a bit of the same, also adding that I chose a language that
I know almost nothing, but I will continue reading about it. The first easy puzzle
but the second one took me a little more.

```
pront> cargo -q run 1
The checksum of the boxes is 5456

pront> cargo -q run 2
Common grade 25 code: megsdlpulxvinkatfoyzxcbvq
```
